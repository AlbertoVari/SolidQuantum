Explanation:

Import necessary libraries: We import WebView from the androidx.webkit package for displaying the website.
MainActivity: This is the entry point of the app. It sets the content of the app using setContent.
MainScreen: This composable function defines the UI of the app.
A Box lays out the content within it.
A remember composable is used to create a single instance of the WebView throughout the app's lifecycle.
The WebView is loaded with the target URL ("https://www.solidledger.com/quantum.html").
A Button is placed at the bottom of the screen using alignAs and align to position it.
Clicking the button calls setContent { MainScreen() }, which essentially reloads the MainScreen composable, effectively navigating back to the home screen.
Note:

import Jetpack Compose in Android Studio :
Open your project's build.gradle file (app-level). This file is usually located at app/build.gradle.
Add the following dependencies within the dependencies block:

dependencies {
    // ... your existing dependencies
    implementation 'androidx.compose:compose-runtime:1.3.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose:compose-ui:1.3.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose:compose-material:1.3.0'
    // Add other Compose libraries as needed
}

Sync your project with Gradle. This will download the necessary libraries for Compose.
